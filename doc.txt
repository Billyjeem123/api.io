X-API-KEY isa normal method for sclig application but when scalling an applicattion

The X-API-KEY method is not a good idea of doing such things

    RThe main goals of using a token is tht we wouldnt be checking
     for validation every now and then

First method apache strips it put before php reads it;
solution either configure  apache or use the apache_request_headers
     // echo $_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'];
$header = apache_request_headers();
echo $header['Authorization'];

{
    "taskname": "Hope",
    "priority": 1,
    "completed": 1,
     "userid": 5
  
}
